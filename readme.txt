The K1 WordPress theme has been made public under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3.0. 

This means that you are free to modify the theme in any way for any purpose (including commercial) without any obligation to the themeâ€™s author. If you decide to redistribute the theme, the licence dictates that you must release the theme under the same licence, GPLv3.

This theme is built with all the necessary WordPress components included with it, so chances are most plugins will be compatible with the theme, but due to the number of plugins available we are unable to check for compatibility with them all individually.

If you install a plugin and encounter issues after trying it, ask the plugin author for support first. If the plugin author says that itâ€™s a problems with the theme, please contact the theme author via github: https://github.com/coder-karen
